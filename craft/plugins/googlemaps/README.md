### Beta Status

Google Maps for Craft is launching with a free public beta. The official license is in the repository, but in short Google Maps for Craft is a commercial plugin that is currently available for free here on Github for the duration of the beta. You have permission to use Google Maps for Craft for any project for free during the beta. Once Google Maps for Craft is available for purchase, the free download will no longer be available and users that want support or updates must purchase a license.

### Roadmap

This software is still in active development with lots of features still to be added. If a feature is missing that you would like to see incorporated into the core, please send us an email to [support@objectivehtml.com](mailto:support@objectivehtml.com) or make an issue here in the repo.
